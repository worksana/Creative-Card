        <h2><pre>    Poem by John P. Read  </pre></h2>
        <pre>
            Love is like a river,
            A never ending stream.
            Love is shared by each other
            To answer someone's dream.

            It's a never ending story;
            Love is not a lie.
            You can share in all its glory,
            For love will never die.

            Love is all around you,
            The moon and stars above.
            Love is a gift from God,
            And God is a gift of love.
